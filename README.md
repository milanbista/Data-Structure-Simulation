# Data-Structure-Simulation
This Repository is for visual representation of data structures like arrays, stack, linked list, which makes it easy to understand how it actually works internally.

#stack : A stack is one of the most important data structure in everyday life. A stack is an ordered collection of items where the insertion and deletion of items always occur at the same end.

The two main principal operation on stack are Push and Pop.

Push: Adds an element to the top of the collection.

Pop: Removes the most recent added elements present at the top
